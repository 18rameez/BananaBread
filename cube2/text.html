The demo might take time to download. Afterwards, press the "fullscreen" button and then "GO!".
Move with WASD, jump with space, look around with the mouse. You can shoot
   a little by clicking the mouse. Some editing stuff works (press 'e' and fly
   around, drag the acorn, etc). You can change the resolution in the menu options (Options->Res tab).

This is a very <b>very</b> early demo - ignore performance and content quality! Notes:
<ul>
<li>The C++ game code has <b>not</b> been optimized at all in any way yet</li>
<li>The level you see when you press "GO!" was made by azakai, a person with <b>0</b>
   artistic talent</li>
<li>The game assets (textures) have <b>not</b> been optimized for faster downloads at all</li>
<li>Very recent development versions of browsers are needed to get all
functionality to work:
  <ul>
    <li>Fullscreen is known to work in at least Firefox 15+ and Chrome 20+</li>
    <li>Mouse lock is known to work in at least Firefox 15+, looks like for Chrome it is
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=72754">planned for Chrome 21</a></li>
    <li>Sound is known to work in Firefox, but fails in Chrome due to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=124926">a problem with BlobBuilder</a></li>
  </ul>
