<h4>
This is the <a href="http://sauerbraten.org/">Sauerbraten</a> 3D FPS compiled from C++ and OpenGL to JavaScript and WebGL
using <a href="http://emscripten.org">Emscripten</a>.

<p>
The demo might take time to download. Afterwards, press the "fullscreen" button and then "GO!".
Move with WASD, jump with space, look around with the mouse. You can shoot
   a little by clicking the mouse. Some editing stuff works (press 'e' and fly
   around).
</p><p>
Please note that
<ul>
<li>The C++ game code has <b>not</b> been optimized at all in any way yet</li>
<li>The generated JavaScript is itself <b>not</b> fully optimized yet, nor even minified</li>
<li>The level you see when you press "GO!" was made by azakai, a person with <b>0</b>
   artistic talent</li>
<li>The game assets (textures) have <b>not</b> been optimized for faster downloads at all</li>
<li>Very recent dev versions of browsers are needed to get all
functionality to work, like fullscreen and pointer lock. Tested as working
in Firefox 15.</li>
</ul>
So this is a very <b>very</b> early demo - ignore performance and content quality!
