        Please note that <b>very</b> recent development versions of browsers are needed to get all
        functionality to work:
        <ul>
          <li>Texture compression is known to work in at least Firefox 15+ and Chrome 20+</li>
          <li>Mouse lock is known to work in at least Firefox 15+, looks like for Chrome it is
              <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=72754">planned for Chrome 22</a> (but it
              <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/mouse-lock">seems to be disabled by default</a>)</li>
          <li>Fullscreen is known to work in at least Firefox 15+ and Chrome 20+</li>
          <li>Sound works in Firefox, but <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=138454">is glitchy in Chrome</a></li>
          <li>Performance is best on latest development versions as well</li>
        </ul>
