    <h1>BananaBread - Troubleshooting</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Please note that up to date versions of modern browers are needed to get all necessary functionality to work, and the demo will not launch if it detects crucial features are missing. Necessary features include:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mouse lock</b> is known to work in Firefox (current stable release, 15+). In Chrome it is not enabled by default, you can switch it on by going to <b>chrome://flags</b> and switching "Pointer Lock" to on.</li>
          <li><b>Texture compression</b> is known to work in at least Firefox 15+ and Chrome 20+.</li>
          <li><b>Fullscreen</b> is known to work in at least Firefox 15+ and Chrome 20+.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the game downloads ok but seems to get stuck during startup, check the web error console and please file an issue on <a href="https://github.com/kripken/BananaBread/">our github page</a> with that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the game runs but crashes the tab or the browser, you should file an issue with the browser so they can fix it. We would appreciate it if you also filed an issue with us linking to it so we can track that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the game runs very slowly in an unexpected way (on a machine with decent graphics hardware that can run other 3D content well), please file an issue on our github page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known issues:
        <ul>
          <li>Internet Explorer can't run the demo because it does not support WebGL yet. Please ask Microsoft to support it.</li>
          <li>Older versions of Safari lack Float64Array and cannot run the compiled code.</li>
          <li>Sound <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=138454">has some glitches in Chrome</a>.</li>
        </ul>
